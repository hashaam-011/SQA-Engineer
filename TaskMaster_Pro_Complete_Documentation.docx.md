TaskMaster Pro - Enterprise QA Engineering Project
Complete Documentation

Project Overview and Approach

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to quality assurance engineering by implementing a full-stack task management application with enterprise-level testing practices. The approach focuses on creating a realistic web application scenario that showcases both frontend and backend testing capabilities. TaskMaster Pro was designed as a professional todo management system with React frontend and Node.js backend, providing all the essential CRUD operations and user authentication flows that are commonly found in real-world applications.

The testing strategy emphasizes practical scenarios including positive and negative test cases, error handling, cross-browser compatibility, and continuous integration practices. By implementing 36 comprehensive test cases across UI and API layers, along with robust CI/CD pipeline integration, this project demonstrates the ability to design, implement, and maintain automated testing solutions that ensure application reliability and quality standards expected in production environments.
